first make a Postgresql container in docker, with a chinker command, or define it 
in a docker-compose. The fields that are important are the `ports`, as well as the
`POSTGRES_USER` variables set in the `.yaml`

Once this is done, have a script called `make_table` with the query to make the table
and another `copy_into_table` or something similar then

run the docker compose
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-postgresql.yaml -p postgres-basic-serv up```

then
```
docker cp make_costdata_table postgres-basic-serv_db_1:/
docker cp copy_costdata_csv_into_table postgres-basic-serv_db_1:/
```

so the files to read commands from are in the docker container

then
```
docker exec -it postgres-basic-serv_db_1 /bin/sh
```

```
psql --username=postgres #or whatever you set in the docker-composer as the postgres user
```

\l to see databases (I think), \dt to list tables, \i <filename> to run contents of <filename>
